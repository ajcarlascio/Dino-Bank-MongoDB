Please note that database URL has been left blank as my mongoDB is currently down and needs to be updated.If you wish to have this working for you, you will need to create a project on mongoDB and fill in the dbURL in server.js.You can learn how to do that here: https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/quick-start-nodejs-mongodb-how-to-get-connected-to-your-database
